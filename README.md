App Version: 1.0.0

This app was created to introduce people to Marvel and DC Comics characters with their lore.

In the application, you will see the lore of one character from each studio.

After downloading an app, you must sign up with your E-Mail, then log in and you will be presented with 2 tabs presented in viewPager on top of the screen: one for marvel, another for DC. You will see corresponding character lore on those tabs.

Stay tuned for updates, as we are planning to add a lot more interesting lore in the nearest future.
